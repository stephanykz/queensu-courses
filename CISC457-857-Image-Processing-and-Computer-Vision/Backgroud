  <h1>Sensing and Acquisition (2.3)</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>Sensors</h2>

    <div>
      <ul class=plain>
	<li>0D point: a photodiode
	<li>1D line: desktop scanner, aerial scans, CT imaging.  Must scan to get 2D image.
	<li>2D array: camera (CCD array)
      </ul>

      <p>A photodiode can have its voltage provided from the front or
      behind.  Behind is more efficient, but somewhat more expensive
      to build.

      <p>A positive voltage at the gate attracts the electrons that
	are freed, through the photoelectric effect, when a photon
	strikes the epitaxial layer (Si + other stuff).
	
      <p>The charge in one photodiode is <em>shifted</em> along a row
	into a charge amplifier, which outputs a sequence of voltages.

      <p>Colour capture uses multiple sensors per pixel.  Light is
	filtered or prismatically refracted.

    <h2>Sensor Noise</h2>

    <div>
      <p>Sensor noise comes from

	<ul class=plain>
	  <li>Lack of quantum efficiency
	  <li>Thermally generated current
	  <li>Charge shifting
	  <li>A/D conversion
	</ul>

	</div>

      <p>Noise is often modelled as "additive Guassian noise":

	<div>
	  <p>sensed value = true value + noise
	  <p>noise is random, but follows a zero-mean Gaussian probability with some standard deviation:

	    <div>
	      $g(x) = {1 \over \sigma \sqrt{2 \; \pi}} e^{- {1 \over 2}( {x-\mu \over \sigma} )^2}$
	    </div>

      <p>"Blooming" is the overflow of electrons from a saturated well to an adjacent well.

  <h1>Sampling and Quantization (2.4)</h1>

  <div>
    <p>An image is a function: $f(x,y)$
    <p>"Sampling" is digitization in the domain $(x,y)$
    <p>"Quantization" is digitization in the range, $f$.

    <div>
      <img src=quantization.png>
      <p><b>[Gonzales and Woods figures 2.16, 2.17]</b>
    </div>
      

    <P>The ranges of $f$, $x$, and $y$ are typically powers of 2:
      <ul class=plain>
	<li>e.g. 12 bits per pixel greyscale is 0...$2^{12}$-1, or 0...4095
	<li>e.g. 8 bits per pixel RGB is (0...255 red, 0...255 green, 0...255 blue)
	<li>e.g. nVidia geforce GTX 980 has image size: 5120 x 5120 x 4 bytes (RGBA) = 62.5 MB
      </ul>

    <p>Note: pixel values typically range in [0...255], but it's better to consider them as real values in [0...1]

    <p>"Dynamic range" is the <em>ratio</em> between the maximum measurable radiance and the minimum detectable radiance
      <ul class=plain>
	<li>max occurs at sensor saturation
	<li>min occurs when noise overwhelms the sensor
      </ul>

    <p>"Contrast" is the <em>difference</em> between the maximum and minimum radiances
  </div>

  <h1>Intensity and Radiance</h1>

  <div>
    <p>"Intensity" is a measure of the brightness of light.  It's really called radiance and defined as follows:

      <div>
	<p>"Flux" is power, measured in Watts ($W$) and approximately proportional to photons per second.
	
	<p>"Flux density" is power of photon crossing a particular
	surface, measured in Watts per square meter ($W / m^2$).

	<p>An angle in 2D is the length of the circumference of a unit
	  circle subtended by the angle, and is measured in radians.
	  Similarly, a "solid angle" in 3D is the area of the surface
	  of a unit sphere subtended by the solid angle, and is
	  measured in "sterradians".

	<p>"Radiance" is flux density of photons crossing a particular
	  surface, lying within a particular solid angle, measured in
	  Watts per square meter per steradian ($W / m^2 / sr$).

      </div>

    <p>Radiance is a radiometric quantity that describes energy along
      a ray.  

    <p>The corresponding <b>photometric</b> quantity is the "nit",
      measured in lumens per square meter per steradian, and describes
      the energy <em>perceived</em> by the eye.  This perceived energy
      depends upon the spectral response of the eye, which varies with
      wavelength.
	  
    different wavelengths differently).

  <h1>Pixel Relationships (2.5)</h1>

  <div>
    <p>In the book: 4-neighbourhood, D-neighbourhood, 8-neighbourhood
    <p>Usual: 1-neighbourhood, 2-neighbourhood, etc.
    <p>A "metric" measures distances between pixels
      <ul class=plain>
	<li>Conditions on a metric $D(p,q)$ between pixel locations $p$ and $q$
	  <ul class=plain>
	    <li>$D(p,q) \geq 0$
            <li>$D(p,q) = 0 \quad \textrm{iff} \quad p=q$
            <li>$D(p,q) = D(q,p)$
            <li>$D(p,q) \leq D(p,r) + D(r,q)$
	  </ul>
	<li>Example metrics:
	  <ul class=plain>
	    <li>Euclidean
	    <li>Manhattan (i.e. sum of absolute coordinates)
	    <li>Chessboard (i.e. max of absolute coordinates)
	  </ul>
	<li>On metric to rule them all: the "p-norm" = $( \sum_i |x_i|^p )^{1 \over p}$
	  <ul class=plain>
	    <li>Euclidean is 2-norm
	    <li>Manhattan is 1-norm
	    <li>Chessboard is infinity-norm
	  </ul>
      </ul>
