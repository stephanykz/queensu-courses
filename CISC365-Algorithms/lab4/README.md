## Part 1 
Suppose that you are designing a replacement airport. Two matching lists are given. The first one contains the arrival times of all the aircraft that use the aiport, and the second one contains the departure times of those same aircraft in the same order.
Design a greedy algorithm to calculate the smallest number of gates that the new airport will require to service all of these aircraft.

## Part 2 
Experiment to see how the number of gates increases as aircraft are allowed to run late, i.e suppose that both arrivals and departures could be 15 minutes (i.e. 0.25 hours), 30 minutes, 45 minutes and an hour late. Model this by selecting a random fraction of the aircraft, and adding a uniformly random delay (up to the possible delay) to their arrival and departure times. (Make sure that departure times remain later than arrival times! If you're feeling really clever, impose a minimum time between arrival and departure of any aircraft.)
How does the number of gates increase as a function of allowed lateness, and the fraction of aircraft that are late?

### Note
Use the test files (start1.csv and finish1.csv, and start2.csv and finish2.csv). The times are expressed in decimal hours for simplicity.
